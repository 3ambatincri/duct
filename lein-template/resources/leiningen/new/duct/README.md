### Developing

To setup a development environment, start a REPL.

```sh
lein repl
```

Run `go` to initiate and start the system.

```clojure
user=> (go)
:started
```

By default this creates a web server at <http://localhost:3000>.

When you make changes to your source files, use `reset` to reload any
modified files and restart the server.

```clojure
user=> (reset)
:reloading (...)
:started
```
