# Duct

Duct is a minimal framework for building web applications in Clojure,
with a strong emphasis on [simplicity][].

Duct is **experimental** and **unreleased** software. Stay tuned.

## Concepts

Duct is built upon existing libraries, including [Ring][],
[Compojure][] and [Component][].

Externally, Duct follows the [Twelve-Factor App][] methodology.

Internally, Duct uses the [Reloaded Workflow][].

Duct discourages global state and dynamic binding.

Duct encourages lexical scoping and component isolation.
