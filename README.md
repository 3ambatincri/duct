# Duct

Duct is a minimal framework for building web applications in Clojure,
with a strong emphasis on [simplicity][].

Duct is **experimental** and **unreleased** software. Stay tuned.

## Usage

Create a new Duct project by running:

```sh
lein new duct <<your project name>>
```

## Concepts

Duct is built upon existing tools and libraries.

Externally, Duct follows the [Twelve-Factor App][] methodology.

Internally, Duct uses the [Reloaded Workflow][].
